# FL Edison Scripts
## Sophisticated Image-Line Edison Scripts
These are my scripts. Not without ChatGPT's help, I made these for myself (and you), and for fun. The things you can do inside Edison (or other sample-based editors) are way more diverse than with plugins. Plugins can only see into the past. Edison sees the whole signal at once. Every sample. That opens up a completely different world.

I'm not much of a plugin developer, but I love experimenting. Always did.
