# FL Edison Scripts
## Sophisticated Image-Line Edison Scripts

These are my scripts. Made these for myself (and you), and for fun, and, the things you can do inside Edison, or other editors, are far more diverse than plugins. Plugins can only see into the past, while Edison can see every single sample point while processing your signal. Opens up a whole different world.

I love coding things that couldn't be remade with plugins. Also, I'm porting processes from [Composer's Desktop Program](/scripts/emptyjp/CDP) :)

Latest additions: [Tubeopath Ultra](/scripts/emptyjp/Saturation/Tubeopath%20Ultra.pyscript), [Psychick Noise True Stereo](/scripts/emptyjp/Misc/Psychick%20Noise%20True%20Stereo.pyscript), [Psychick Modulations](/scripts/emptyjp/Misc/Psychick%20Modulations.pyscript), [Heaven or Las Vegas](/scripts/emptyjp/Misc/Heaven%20Or%20Las%20Vegas.pyscript)
## How to install these???

Simple. Just get the scripts folder, then, put the emptyjp folder in:
\%UserProfile%\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Audio scripts

(you can press Win+R if you're on Windows and paste the path above)

Aaaand, it'll be **right there!**
