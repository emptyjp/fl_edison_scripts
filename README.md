# FL Edison Scripts
## Sophisticated Image-Line Edison Scripts.
These are my scripts. Not without ChatGPT's help, I made these for myself (and you), and for fun, and, the things you can do inside Edison, or other editors, are far more diverse than plugins. Plugins can only see into the past, while Edison can see every single sample point while processing your signal.

I'm not that much of a plug-in developer, but, I certainly love experimentation.
